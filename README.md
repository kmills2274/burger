Welcome to Good Burger- home of the Good Burger. Can I take your order?!

About this app:

*Good Burger Ordering App is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.


*Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be sent to the cook.


*Each burger in the waiting area also has a send button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

*Each burger in the pick-up area has a + button, and you can "pick up" your food by clicking it. 


*The app will store every burger in a database, whether picked up or not.
